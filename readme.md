# rust-rustfc
rust(game) furnace calculator writen in rust

rewrote my rustfc, which I first writen in python

# how to use
run `cargo run [amount] [material] [furnace_type] [optional_amount_of_furnaces]`

# why?
because if you have 6 large furnaces and 100_000 of sulfur you want to know how much wood it will cost and time consumed!

...and also because rustrustfc is a funny name
